# Opposition-to-Racial-Activism-and-Education

The United States has a long history of racial injustice and conflict, and the country remains divided on its recognition and concern about racial discrimination, racial inequality, and the legacy of slavery. Though certainly not new, over the past several years, activism and pressure for social change to improve racial equity has been increasing and nationally focal. There has been resistance and counter-activism in reaction to these attempts at change. This paper will look at opposition to two activities geared toward recognizing and addressing racial inequality – the Black Lives matter Movement (BLM) and including information on the country’s history of racial and ethnic oppression in school curriculum.


Research Question
•	“How and why do states differ on their opposition to activities focused on addressing race in the U.S.?” 
Specifically:
•	Do differences in state characteristics in education, economics, policing, political ideology, and diversity associate with level of opposition to BLM?  
•	Do differences in state characteristics in education, economics, political ideology, and diversity associate with whether states have actively engaged in legislative action to limit race education in schools?


Main Tasks: 
•	Used Tableau to better visualize the % of state population in opposition to BLM & active or in-process anti-CRT legislation in the U.S. 
•	Compuated and Compared variables in relation to race attitudes by states
  •	Variables - Education, Racial and Ethnic Diversity, Economy, Political Ideology, Police Activity
•	Ran a regression that predicts the % opposed to BLM as a function of the 7 variables on education, economics, diversity, political ideology and policing
•	Ran a regression that predicts whether a state has or is actively pursuing legislation to limit race education
•	Drafted a professional report for both audiences with statistical background and audiences without statistical background
